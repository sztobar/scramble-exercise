## Development

Open a terminal and type `lein repl` to start a Clojure REPL
(interactive prompt).

In the REPL, type

```clojure
(go)
(cljs-repl)
```

The call to `(go)` starts the Figwheel server at port 3449, which takes care of
live reloading ClojureScript code, and the app server at port 10555
which forwards requests to the http-handler you define.

Running `(cljs-repl)` starts the Figwheel ClojureScript REPL. Evaluating
expressions here will only work once you've loaded the page, so the browser can
connect to Figwheel.

When you see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js" in 21.36
seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to `http://localhost:10555` and enjoy.

**Attention: It is not needed to run `lein figwheel` separately. Instead `(go)`
launches Figwheel directly from the REPL**


## Testing

To run the Clojure tests, use

``` shell
lein test
```
